I am a dedicated and ambitious engineering graduate with a passion for innovation and problem-solving. With strong technical expertise in Java, Python, web development, and SQL, I love building efficient and scalable solutions.

I have hands-on experience in frontend design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and integrating applications with the Frappe framework. On the backend, I work with JDBC, Servlets, and SQL/NoSQL databases to create dynamic and robust systems.

Beyond coding, I am proficient in using Eclipse, VS Code, MySQL Workbench, and APIs to streamline development. I thrive in collaborative environments, bringing strong leadership, communication, and teamwork skills to the table.

I am always eager to learn, grow, and take on new challenges that push my boundaries. Looking forward to contributing to innovative projects and making an impact!
